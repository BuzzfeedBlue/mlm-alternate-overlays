Let me preface this project with: I am not a coder and Im surprised I even got this to load

This plugin is a quick and dirt copy and paste of the main motherlode plugin, but changed
so that the paydirt overlay icon is not the mining skilling icon, but the minimap
mining spot icon. I prefer it aesthetically over the original. You can use the
original plugin and this one at the same time, just switch off the original's vein overlay
option and use Motherlode2's version.
